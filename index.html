        <p>My inspiration is j.K Rowling. She inspired me to have a hobby for wtiting stories. (I am also working on many stories with my friends).But now I am going to focus this on her. She wrote my altime favorite series whivh I have read all the books and watched all the movies 3 times: Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling was rejected 12 times, before a publisher finally agreed to publish her books. Her books were turned into movies. She was the first author to become a millionare. J.K Rowling is my favorite author and my inspiration.</p>

        <p>My altime favorite book series is <i>Harry Potter.</i> Here is the list in order of the 8-book series:
            Book 1- <i> Harry Potter and the Scorcerer&#39;s Stone</i>,
            Book 2- <i> Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets</i>,
            Book 3- <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>,
            Book 4- <i> Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire></i>,
            Book 5- <i> Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix></i>,
            Book 6- <i> Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince></i>,
            Book 7- <i> Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows></i>,
            Book 8- <i> Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i>,
            I have read all the books at least 3 times. And I have watvhed all the movies at least 3 times (except for <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i> since it hasn't come out yet). The Harry Potter series is far and away the highest-selling series of novels ever. Written by British author J.K. Rowling, the series has sold at least 500 million copies, 150 million more than the next-highest selling series.These books are full of mystery, adventure, and multiple plot twists and I couldn't be happier! The Harry Potter books are a must for any fantasy, magical readers. I rate it an easy infinity star! J.K. Rowling wrote a masterpiece and everyone (no matter the age) will fall in love with the wizarding world.</p>

        <p>I have read all the Harry Potter books, which I have mentioned a lot so you already know. So I am also going to tell you some of the other books I have read:
            &nbsp;
            <i>Sweep: The Story of a Girl and Her Monster,</i>
            &nbsp;
            &nbsp;
            <i>The Girl Who Drank the Moon,</i>
            &nbsp;
            <i>Out Of My Mind,</i>
            &nbsp;
            <i>Front Desk,</i>
            &nbsp;
            <i>The Van Gough Deception,</i>
            &nbsp;
            <i>Small Spaces,</i>
            &nbsp;
            <i>Bob,</i>
            &nbsp;
            <i>The Miscalculations of Lightning Girl,</i>
            &nbsp;
            <i>Strongheart,</i>
            &nbsp;
            <i>Hope in the Holler,</i>
            &nbsp;
            and I have read hundreds of more books, of course, but I of course can't fit all of them here. It would take ages if I did, and I probably don't remember every single book I read.
